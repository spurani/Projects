                </p>

                <p>A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province,
                    or other administrative region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that
                    physically encompasses the government's offices and meeting places; the status as capital is often designated
                    by its law or constitution.</p>
